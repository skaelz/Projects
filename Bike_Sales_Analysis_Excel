Excel Project

Question: What is my target market with my customers?
Answer: male, 31-55 year old, low-commute, upperclass customers. 

Data Setup and Cleaning
Created a working sheet with the raw data
Cleansed the data by removing duplicates and standardizing abbreviations for clarity.

Data Formatting and Segmentation
Formatted columns to ensure consistency and readability.
Ensured that currency values were formatted correctly.
Created "age brackets" to make the data easier to visualize and analyze.
Prepared the data for visualization by segmenting it into age groups using nested IF statements.

Pivot Tables and Visualizations
Used pivot tables to analyze average income concerning bike purchases, broken down by gender.
Visualized the data through charts, highlighting gender-wise income disparities and purchase patterns by age group.

Dashboard Creation and Enhancement
Crafted a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard with aligned visualizations.
Not Shown- I would also include pivot table slicers to organize and filter the data, but I am limited with Microsoft Office 365 Online. 

Quick Analysis
From my understanding, the bike shopâ€™s target market should be focus on Middle Aged (31-55) customers with a slight focus on a male demographic that work within 3 miles of their homes. 
For example, if there was a housing complex within 3 miles next to a hospital or business park there could be reason to market there. More analysis and data is needed to understand sub-demographics, types of bikes, etc. 
to come to a more accurate solution before spending ad dollars.
