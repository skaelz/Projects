A new app with about a 3.5 user score would do well in the market.

The top-rated app for Books is Color Therapy for Adults, with an average 5-star rating from 84000+ total ratings.

Conclusion:
After thorough analysis, it appears that a paid Finance or Book app supporting 10-30 languages, maintaining an average rating of 3.5 or higher, and offering a detailed product description of 1000 characters+ could thrive in the current market. However, it is important to avoid either a color therapy book or a Credit Karma clone to stand out. To gain deeper insights, a closer examination of customer preferences, app subcategories, and preferred languages is necessary for a more comprehensive strategy.
